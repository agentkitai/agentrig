Resolve the project's declared reviewer slots from `.agentrig/config.json` at the PR head,
not home config or runtime provider defaults. Missing `reviewers` or `{}` means zero slots.
Config declares 0, 1 or 2 named slots, each with an adapter id and a pinned model; no check capability flag.
Validate config before dispatch with `parseConfigText`; never replace project pins from local preferences.
Use `scripts/reviewer-adapters.mjs` for CLI command templates, model extraction and failed/empty-run detection.
An `api:<name>` adapter references the existing `providers.<name>` entry, whose model must equal
the slot's pinned model; it duplicates no endpoints, credentials or routing. See shipping policy §3.
