This policy implements shipping policy §3's declared reviewer slots and check ordering rule
and supersedes conflicting inherited ship/land check instructions for this task. Workflow decisions stay in skills, never core or
a CLI workflow runner. Resolve the explicit repository's `.agentrig/config.json` checks and
selected project profile with `packages/cli/dist/project-checks.js` → `resolveProjectChecks(root, profile)`
(or inspect that documented JSON boundary); see docs/TESTING.md. Missing declaration is not
an empty declaration: stop and request one, never guess a language or package manager.
Project profile checks replace the whole base declaration.
