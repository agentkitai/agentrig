## M0 notes

- `HarnessEvent` = envelope (`seq`, `sessionId`, `ts`, stamped by the store) + discriminated `EventPayload`.
- `SessionStore` is append-only JSONL, one file per session; `read` validates every line and fails on seq gaps.
- `memory` and `supervisor` export interfaces only.
- `pnpm demo` writes a session containing the exact loop pattern M4's `loop` detector must catch.

## M1 notes

- `agentrig run "<task>" --headless --json` works end to end; `ask` resolves to deny headless.
  Without `--headless` on a TTY, `ask` prompts on stderr via `AgentConfig.onAsk` (the same seam
  the M7 TUI will use).
- Tools declare `paths()`; `cwdOnly` permission rules confine file tools to the project.
  `--allow write` is cwd-confined; `--allow write:anywhere` lifts it. bash declares no paths and
  cannot be confined — `--allow exec` is all-or-nothing.
- Stop reasons: `refusal` ends the session `done` with a non-fatal error event; a final response
  truncated at `max_tokens` ends it `reason: error` (CLI exit 1); unknown provider stop reasons
  surface verbatim via `raw` in the fatal error message.
- `steer()` takes an optional source (`user` default; the M4 supervisor passes its own); a steer
  still queued when the session ends is recorded as a non-fatal error, never silently dropped.
- Every event — including `file.changed` emitted from inside tools — goes through
  `SessionStore.append` on one promise chain, so `seq` order is emission order and
  `session.events` replays identically to the on-disk log.
- `ToolResult` gained optional `isError`: expected failures (non-zero exit, missing file, bad
  regex) reach the model as error tool_results; throwing is for unexpected failures only.
- Anthropic adapter speaks the streaming REST API directly (no vendor SDK) with an injectable
  `fetchFn`, so tests exercise the full SSE path with no network.
- Budgets are enforced at turn boundaries; `maxUsd` binds only when `pricing` is configured.
- Deferred to their milestones, per build order: hooks, compaction, resume (M2), TUI (M7).

## Exit-criterion debt: dogfooding

PLAN §6's exit criterion ("the harness is used to build the next milestone") is **not yet met**:
M1 and M2 were built without running the harness. Two live smoke attempts against
`gpt-5.6-sol` (2026-08-29, reports on PR #2) got as far as real streaming requests: the first
was blocked by the environment's network allowlist, the second by an exhausted OpenAI credit
balance. Both validated the error path live — well-formed fatal `error` events carrying the
provider's response verbatim, `session.end reason=error`, exit 1, clean log replay — and the
second prompted retry/backoff in the adapters (below). M3 must be built through `agentrig run`
(worker sessions for real subtasks, resume and compaction under real load) once the OpenAI
account has credits.

## M2 notes

- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` speaks Chat Completions streaming (OpenAI + local servers); one
  unified user message fans out to individual `tool` role messages; `apiKey` is optional for
  keyless local servers; same injectable `fetchFn` and truncated-tool-JSON guard as the
  Anthropic adapter. New event type `session.resume` (zod variant + render case + tests).
- Compaction defaults on: `summarizeOlderTurns()` fires past 70% of the provider's context
  window, keeps the task message and the last N messages verbatim (boundary widened so no
  tool_result is orphaned), and summarizes the middle via a direct provider call — that call is
  not metered by the budget. Emits `context.compact`.
- Resume: the loop writes a snapshot (`<id>.snapshot.json`, atomic overwrite) after every
  completed turn and at session end; `run(task, {resume: id})` restores messages/turns/usage/usd
  from it, appends to the same JSONL with contiguous `seq`, and emits `session.resume`. The log
  stays the source of truth — the snapshot is a cache; resuming without one fails loudly.
  CLI: `agentrig sessions resume <id> [task...]` and `run --resume <id>`; `--provider openai`
  with `--base-url` for local servers.
- Hardening from the M2 adversarial review: compaction is raced against abort and gets the
  session signal (a hung or failing summarization call can no longer wedge or kill a session;
  no-progress compaction warns once and stops retrying); snapshots synthesize error
  tool_results for a trailing unanswered `tool_use` so interrupted sessions stay resumable, and
  a resumed run that completed no turn never overwrites the prior snapshot; resume takes an
  advisory `<id>.lock` so concurrent resumes fail loudly instead of corrupting the log's seq
  order (a crashed holder's lock must be deleted by hand — the error names the path); the
  OpenAI adapter sends `max_completion_tokens` against api.openai.com (`max_tokens` for other
  base URLs, `maxTokensParam` to override); when a provider reports no usage the loop warns
  once and compaction falls back to estimates. `maxTurns`/`maxTokens`/`maxUsd` bind across
  resumes; `maxMinutes` is per-run wall clock; resuming a budget-ended session requires
  raising the budget.

## Post-M2 hardening (from live smoke findings)

- Both adapters retry transient HTTP failures (429 rate limits, 5xx, network errors) with
  exponential backoff honoring `Retry-After`, capped at 3 retries / 30s, abort-aware; a 429
  that is quota/billing exhaustion fails immediately (retrying can't help). `RetryPolicy` is
  per-provider config.
- Headless `--json` mode mirrors fatal error events to stderr so a human tailing the process
  sees them without parsing the event stream.

## M2.5 notes

- `OpenAIChatGPTProvider` speaks the Responses API against
  `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` with Codex's headers (`originator: codex_cli_rs`
  impersonation, per the accepted §2.9 decision), authed by the OAuth access token.
  `OpenAIChatGPTAuth` owns the device-code login, an atomic token store (default
  `~/.agentrig/openai-chatgpt-auth.json`, `AGENTRIG_OPENAI_CHATGPT_AUTH` to override), and
  proactive + 401-forced refresh that persists refresh-token rotation. CLI:
  `agentrig login openai-chatgpt` then `run --provider openai-chatgpt --model gpt-5.6-sol`.
- **Not yet validated live.** The endpoint/headers/payload and the device-code and refresh JSON
  field names are read from the Apache-2.0 openai/codex source and RFC-8628-style conventions;
  everything is unit-tested with injected fetch (request mapping, SSE parsing, refresh/rotation,
  expiry, device poll), but the first real `login` + `run` against OpenAI is the live check.
  Expect small field-name fixes on first contact; the provider is experimental by design.
- **Auth reuse for cloud/unattended runs.** Authorize once, then seed every session: run
  `agentrig login openai-chatgpt` on any machine, `agentrig login openai-chatgpt --export` to
  print the bundle, and set it as `AGENTRIG_OPENAI_CHATGPT_TOKEN` in the environment. A fresh
  container with no token file reads that env var (AgentRig's own shape *or* a pasted Codex
  `~/.codex/auth.json`), and within-session refresh still writes to the file. The interactive
  browser approval is inherently human and one-time — the harness cannot and should not perform
  it; the seed makes it a once-per-token step, not once-per-session.
- Concurrency caveat: one subscription token should have a single refresh owner. Fanning out
  many resumed/parallel worker sessions on one token can race on refresh-token rotation; a
  static env seed sidesteps this only while the access token is still valid (~hours).

## Decided

- Lore is an optional `MemoryBackend` behind the seam in PLAN.md §3.8; the wiki stays the source
  of truth and the default stays no-infra (milestone 3b).
- AgentLens is a future sink for the event stream (observability), not a memory dependency.

## Open questions (from PLAN.md §8)

1. Sandboxing: none + allowlists for v1, Docker later
2. Git-based checkpoint rollback: opt-in or assumed
3. Dogfood repo after AgentRig itself
