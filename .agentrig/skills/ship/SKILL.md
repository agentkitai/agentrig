# Ship flow — one command from task to merge decision

Read [shipping policy](../../../docs/SHIPPING-WORKFLOW.md) before acting. Its shared
CI scheduling, finding disposition, material-delta and convergence rules govern this flow.

You are the conductor, not a performer. The building happens in a subagent and the reviewing in
external CLI jobs you run; your job is sequencing and relaying results faithfully. Merge remains
a human decision, but that decision may be supplied up front, not only after the review.
Do not implement, review, or fix anything in this session yourself.

Capture any explicit upfront authorization to merge the PR for this named task as a verbatim
human-message quote, together with the task scope. Carry it through builder/fixer/lander handoffs;
once a PR exists, bind it to that PR number. Follow land's authorization checks, including later
revocation or narrowing. Do not infer authorization from YOLO or a tool allowance.

## Initial full review heading contract

The two initial external review comments must each start with this exact heading form:
`## External review — <reviewer> (<model>) — head <SHA> — merged with origin/main <MAIN> — full`
Substitute the actual reviewer, model, full reviewed PR head SHA and full origin/main SHA.
The conductor (or standalone dogfood author) posts one for Claude Code and one for Codex.
No alternate heading is valid for posting,
acceptance or rerun detection. Require the complete heading, not just its prefix or a SHA
elsewhere in the body. This form is for the initial full pair, not focused delta verdicts.

## Review scratch cleanup

Human cleanup contract (verbatim):

> After the initial review pair and after any focused delta review, the conductor removes the review output directory (`OUT`) and the reviewer temporary roots in addition to both worktrees and the `review-base-NN` branch; builders and fixers remove their own proof TMPDIR after recording its results in the PR body. Removal happens only after joining every job and verifying restored tracked/index state, and never touches the author's tree.

Operative resource mapping: initial reviews remove the pass’s recorded owned `WT`, `CODEX_WT` and `review-base-NN`; focused reviews remove the pass’s recorded owned single `WT` and unique `BASE`. Both also remove any recorded owned conductor-trio tree and conductor-trio temporary root (including extra exact-head proof trees). Both remove their recorded owned `OUT` and reviewer temporary roots only after all jobs are joined, tracked/index restoration is verified, and evidence is persisted.

Use topic's **Review scratch cleanup** sequence for every initial and focused pass, including failure/retry/staleness paths. The standalone dogfood author assumes conductor cleanup duties for its reviews. Builders/fixers record command exit codes, test counts, fail-first/mutation results and times in the PR body, join every proof job, verify restored tracked/index state, then, after the branch is pushed and handoff is recorded in the PR body, remove their recorded owned worktree and proof TMPDIR under dogfood §1; do not wait for hosted CI. Keep proof TMPDIR outside Git ancestry per docs/TESTING.md.

## 1. Build

Apply dogfood §1 to builders, continuation builders and fixers in every handoff: use an
owned worktree created from `origin/main` for new work, or attach/reuse the existing branch's
owned worktree for continuations and repairs. Never change the author checkout's branch.
Require the worktree path in the PR body and remove it after recording handoff, with all jobs
joined, tracked/index state restored and proof persisted. The conductor removes recorded owned
leftovers after landing under the same checks; never remove the author checkout or unowned trees.

- Spawn a subagent with a self-contained task: the issue/roadmap row to implement, plus
  "Follow the dogfood skill. You are a ship child: stop at the PR and skip the external reviews —
  an independent review follows." Include everything it needs in the task text — a subagent
  gets none of this conversation.
- If its report ends with `DEVIATION REQUESTED`, do not judge the proposal yourself: spawn an
  `arbiter` subagent with the proposal, the contract verbatim, and the human's invocation line;
  on APPROVE spawn a continuation builder on the same branch carrying the verdict block and the
  arbiter's session id; on REJECT spawn one carrying the rejection and "build the row as
  written", or stop for the human if the builder said the row as written is infeasible.
- Its report should name the PR it opened, the head SHA, and CI state on that head.
  Explicitly tell builders and fixers: return immediately after push/PR, without waiting for
  hosted CI; the conductor starts review and CI monitoring concurrently. If it died
  at its turn budget instead, report its session id so the human can resume it
  (`agentrig sessions resume <id>`), and stop — do not re-spawn a fresh builder over a
  half-pushed branch.

Remove registered worktrees with `git worktree remove <path>`, then `git worktree prune`
after the recorded handoff and join/state/proof checks. Never use bare directory deletion
for a worktree; remove the owned proof TMPDIR separately.

## 2. Review, independently

- Run the external review pass exactly as `topic` §2 step 4 prescribes: two external reviewers
  (Claude Code pinned to `claude-opus-5`, and Codex) in parallel in separate reviewer-owned worktrees you prepare, the
  model asserted from `modelUsage`, both reviews posted as PR comments, findings tagged and merged.
  Never review in this session and never pass the builder's report to either reviewer; the PR and
  the code are their only inputs.

Follow topic §2 step 4's conductor trio and shipping policy §3: the independently run,
same-head conductor checks supply the Codex trio evidence in the initial comment provenance.
The standalone dogfood author assumes the conductor role in fresh reviewer-owned trees;
its author-tree proof is not independent evidence. Preserve each reviewer environment limitation
and require the author's trio, the independent trio and exact-head CI green for landing.
Never halt solely because Codex cannot run the suite; actual failures and missing proof
still follow the shared landing gates.

## 3. Resolve the verdict, then honor the merge decision

- Present the verdict verbatim-in-substance: every finding with its severity, or the pass with
  its evidence, plus PR number, CI state, and the initial review URLs and any focused delta review URL. This is a progress report, not an unconditional stop.
- Apply shipping policy §2 to every finding. Batch blocking repairs only; defer non-blocking
  defects with issue links and advisory polish to the roadmap when useful. Contract or
  authorization findings still go to an arbiter before the fixer.
  A fixable verdict does not wait for the human: perform authorized blocking repairs unasked.
Before calling a fixer, perform this ordered persistence gate (including on resumption):

1. Persist the PR body with `gh pr edit NN --body-file <ledger-file>`: update
   `## Review disposition` with every finding, its severity and disposition; increment
   `Repair round: N/3` (at most 3, never reset on restart), recording OLD and assigned blocker IDs.
   Update `## Residuals` with deferred defect issue links or none. Require edit success before proceeding;
   a private note or an instruction for the fixer to update it later is not persistence.
2. Only then call the fixer described below, carrying that persisted ledger and counter.

- Spawn the fixer on the same branch with exact blocker texts/URLs. After its local proof and
  push, classify OLD..NEW under shipping policy §3: ONE independent focused reviewer for a
  material delta, evidence-only for a mechanical delta. Use topic §3's **Cover the delta** procedure
  for isolated preparation, installation, launch, provenance and cleanup. Never repeat the initial external pair
  for each fix. At most three repair rounds, preserving the counter on resumption; unresolved
  blockers or non-convergence halt, while new advisory notes do not open another round.
- When scoped merge authorization is present, run the `land` skill's steps (in this session or a
  land subagent) without asking for a second approval. Pass the verbatim human quote, task scope
  and PR number; require green exact-head CI and watch post-merge CI before reporting completion.
  Otherwise report the reviewed PR and wait for explicit merge authorization.
- No answer is an answer: never treat silence, a timeout, or your own confidence as approval.
  A run awaiting missing authorization is a reviewed PR awaiting authorization, not a completed
  end-to-end shipment. An authorized run is complete only after land reports green post-merge CI.

## 4. Budget and honesty

- Keep your own turns few — the work happens in the children. If a child fails, relay its actual
  failure; never paper over a red trio or a review finding to make the cycle look complete.
- Every child has its own session log; name the session ids and the URLs of the two external
  initial review comments and any focused delta review in your final report so the full audit trail is one
  `sessions show` away.
